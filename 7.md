By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.
What is the 10 001st prime number?
```

# Py
```
def nthPrime(maxcount):
	primes = []
	n = 2
	while len(primes) != maxcount:
		isprime = True
		for p in primes:
			if (n % p == 0):
				isprime = False
				break
		if isprime:
			primes.append(n)
		n += 1
	return primes[-1]

print(nthPrime(6))
```
