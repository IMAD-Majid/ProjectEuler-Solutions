```
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with
1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum
of the even‚Äêvalued terms.
```

# Python
```
def fib(length, seq=[1, 2], sumall=0):
	if len(seq) == length:
		return sumall
	newFib = seq[-1] + seq[-2]
	seq.append(newFib)
	if (newFib % 2 == 0):
		sumall += newFib
	print(len(seq))
	return fib(length, seq, sumall)


print(fib(10))
print(fib(4000000))
```
