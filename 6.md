The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1**2 + 2**2 + ... + 10**2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)**2 = 55**2 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of
the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the
square of the sum.

```

# Python
```
def solve(nmax):
	sumsquares = 0
	nsum = 0
	for n in range(1, nmax+1):
		sumsquares += n**2
		nsum += n
	squaresum = nsum**2
	return squaresum - sumsquares

print(solve(10))
