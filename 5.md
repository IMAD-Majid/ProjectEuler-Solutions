2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any
remainder.
What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
```

# Python
```
divisors = [n for n in range(1, 11)]
n = 1
while True:
	divisibleByAll = True
	for d in divisors:
		if (n % d != 0):
			divisibleByAll = False
			break
	if divisibleByAll:
		print(n)
		break
	n += 1
```
